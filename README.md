This house was designed inward looking than outward because of concerns of visual privacy being disturbed due to surrounding structures. This meant that the interiors had to give a lot of freshness and relief to the eye rather than having dark spaces with darker finishes. With three generations staying in one home, the marriage of material and colour across the home was the important factor while designing the interiors.  The climate being another consideration, small details like the use of wooden floors to create warmth on ones feet during the sharp winter temperatures, were also a strong point of consideration in the design. Security was another major point the client wanted us to consider as his past home had been broken in by thieves. Hence the clever detail of invisible rolling shutters which get camouflaged by the curtains of the home at night was a very key detail to ensure that the interiors didnâ€™t lose its charm when the grills were brought down. From customized designer curtains and cushions to the choice of art, not one corner of this home was left untouched without detail and brought comfort to all three generations of this family.
